##Story
###The Discord 235 Admins have disabled our sacred wehat! We must sneak past their bans and other defenses as we search for the beloved symbol of the class. Will you embark on this light-hearted stealth game?

##Esthetics
###8bit animation style with a single epic 8bit track going in the background.

##Gameplay
###The player can choose to hide themselves at text but only if they are within the proper tag. You are able to see the guards view but will not be able to see their path. You win by finding the wehat without getting spotted by any of the guards.
